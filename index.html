            <h2>Our Features</h2>
            <p>At the heart of this tool lies simplicity and effectiveness, empowering you to develop a skillset that’s often underestimated — reading efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Confidence Through Reading</h3>
            <p>Improving your reading speed isn't just about faster consumption of text; it's about building confidence in your ability to tackle new information, grasp complex topics, and feel empowered in both personal and professional settings. Mastering reading efficiency boosts overall confidence in learning, allowing you to approach materials with greater ease.</p>

            <h3>Know Your Strengths</h3>
            <p>Understanding your current reading ability can be a powerful tool. This test helps you track your progress, uncover your strengths, and identify areas where you might improve, all while boosting your comprehension — not just speed.</p>

            <h3>Real-Time Reading Speed Calculation</h3>
            <p>Our test captures your reading speed accurately and provides insightful statistics on your progress. See how your average speed improves over time and track your journey as you become a more efficient reader.</p>

            <h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
            <p>Because reading isn't just about speed, we've included comprehension questions to make sure you’re absorbing what you read. These questions are tailored to the passages, so you get a holistic measure of your reading ability.</p>

            <h3>Personalized Settings</h3>
            <p>Make your reading experience truly yours with customizable font sizes and styles. We want to ensure the experience is comfortable for you, so you can focus on the content rather than the interface.</p>

            <h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
            <p>Monitor your improvement across multiple sessions. The system keeps a log of your past speeds and comprehension scores, giving you tangible data on how far you’ve come.</p>
