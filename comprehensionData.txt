The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, occurs when charged particles from the Sun collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, creating a spectacular light show. |flare

The Dead Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water on Earth, allowing people to float effortlessly due to its high salt density. |brine

The Earth's magnetic field, generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core, protects the planet from harmful solar radiation. |shield

Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. |vortex

The Sahara Desert, the largest hot desert in the world, was once a lush, green landscape with lakes and rivers thousands of years ago. |dunes

Volcanoes can form not only on Earth but also on other planets and moons; Olympus Mons on Mars is the largest volcano in the solar system. |crater

Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates shift, releasing energy that travels as seismic waves through the Earth's crust. |quake

The Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans, plunges nearly 36,000 feet below the surface, deeper than Mount Everest is tall. |abyss

The Moon was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body. |lunar

The planet Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings, made mostly of ice and rock, which are thought to be remnants of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons. |rings

Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth, and it holds about 60% of the world’s fresh water in its ice sheets. |glacier

Meteorites, pieces of asteroids or comets that fall to Earth, provide valuable clues about the early solar system’s formation. |fragment

The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Australia, is the largest living structure on the planet and can even be seen from space. |reef

Yellowstone National Park sits atop a supervolcano, one of the largest in the world, with the potential to cause massive global impact if it were to erupt. |caldera

The Amazon River, the largest river by discharge volume of water, flows through the world’s largest rainforest, a vital source of biodiversity. |current

Earth is the only planet in the solar system known to have plate tectonics, which help recycle the Earth's crust and regulate its climate. |plates

The Moon is slowly drifting away from Earth at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year, gradually affecting the length of our days. |orbit

Mars has the tallest known mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands nearly three times higher than Mount Everest. |peak

Earth's atmosphere extends up to 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers), but 75% of it is contained within the first 10 miles (16 kilometers) above the surface. |stratosphere

The Sun contains 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system, with its gravity keeping the planets in orbit. |fusion

Venus, often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size, has surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead due to its thick, toxic atmosphere. |inferno

The Earth's tectonic plates move at the same rate that human fingernails grow, about 2 to 5 centimeters per year. |drift

Geysers, like those found in Yellowstone, erupt when underground water is heated by magma and rapidly expands, shooting steam and water into the air. |steam

The Sahara Desert expands at a rate of about 30 miles per year, encroaching on surrounding arable land due to desertification. |spread

The Earth's crust is divided into continental and oceanic plates, with the oceanic plates being denser and thinner than their continental counterparts. |rift

Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, has supersonic winds that blow at speeds of up to 1,200 miles per hour (1,931 kilometers per hour). |gale

Mount Vesuvius in Italy is one of the most dangerous volcanoes on Earth, famously erupting in AD 79 and burying the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. |lava

Earth’s magnetic north pole is constantly moving due to changes in the Earth's core, drifting towards Siberia at about 40 miles per year. |compass

Lightning strikes Earth about 8 million times per day, creating powerful bolts of electricity that heat the air to temperatures hotter than the Sun’s surface. |bolt

The Earth's oceans cover more than 70% of the planet's surface, and over 80% of them remain unexplored. |depths

The rings of Saturn are relatively young, possibly formed just 100 million years ago, and may eventually disappear over time. |orbit

Earth is not a perfect sphere; it bulges at the equator due to its rotation, making it an oblate spheroid. |axis

Mercury has the most extreme temperature fluctuations in the solar system, ranging from -330°F (-201°C) at night to 800°F (427°C) during the day. |mercury

Tornadoes, which form when warm, moist air meets cold, dry air, can produce winds up to 300 miles per hour, causing devastating damage. |funnel
